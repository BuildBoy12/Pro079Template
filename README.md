# Pro079Template
This is a template repository for any of you interested in making a command or an ultimate for [**Pro079**](https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/)

# How to start
- Click the big green **"Use this template"** button to begin importing it to your own GitHub account.
- Comments are provided to guide you if any of this isn't familiar to you.

## Important:
- Change variable names and the namespace with Ctrl+R Ctrl+R in Visual Studio, and don't forget to change the stuff within `Properties` (right click it, open it), same goes for the `Assembly-Info` file (although the GUID shouldn't matter too much).
- Reference [0Pro079.dll](https://github.com/RogerFK/pro079/releases) and [Smod2.dll](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/releases) by directly placing it in the root folder (same as the `.sln` one) and the solution will automatically detect it.
